# Brunc Demo

### Install Brunch 

npm install -g brunch

### Development

The application logic is stored in the brunch/app directory. To develop, `cd` to the brunch directory. From there, you can watch for changes or build the app.

```
$ brunch watch
$ brunch w -s         # Shorthand, -s runs a local server on port 3333

$ brunch build        # or
$ brunch b

```

You will need to install any Brunch dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```
